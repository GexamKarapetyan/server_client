I have provided server-client connection by ipv4 protocol. It's capable to accept up to 5 clients simultaneously. Server have a command handler which can recieve commands from client and respond. We have 3 commands - disconnect , get_time and --help. Client part has command line interface. Supported commands are connect, disconnect , get_time and --help.
