I have provided server-client connection by ipv4 protocol.
It's capable to accept up to 5 clients simultaneously.
Server has a command handler which can recieve commands from client and respond them.
There are 2 commands - disconnect and get_time.
Client part has a command line interface.
Supported commands are-connect, disconnect, get_time and clear.
